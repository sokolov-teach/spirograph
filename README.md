# spirograph
These are After Effects and Python files that were made in the process of creating the video for the contest. 

In the python file you can quickly find the parameters of the beautiful spirals. With the After Effects file, you can render the final image. But this may require a lot of resources of your computer.

If you share or adapt the work, please be sure to mention the video itself.
